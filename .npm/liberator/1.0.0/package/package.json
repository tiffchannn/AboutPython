Employers will see these repositories\n  will care about one thing: that you've been writing code for three solid\n  months.\n- **DO NOT** publish any curriculum outside of (or otherwise circumvent)\n  Liberator. Hack Reactor's curriculum represents thousands of hours of work put in by many different individuals, and not all of it is public domain.\n  (Curriculum does not, of course, include personal projects, group projects,\n  etc. Those should be public already, unless the particular constraints of your project dictated that it be private.)\n- **DO** publish your repositories before graduating. You don't have to publish your sprints in 'real time' if you don't want to. You're welcome to publish them all at once during the second half of the course instead. Just know that Hack Reactor will delete your cohort's\n  master curriculum repositories twelve weeks after your graduation. If you do\n  not publicize your repositories before then, your work will be lost forever.\n\n## Installation\n\nIt is recommended to use 6.11.x version of node. To install a specific version of node, install [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), then run:\n\n```sh\nnvm install 6.11.2\n```\n\n__NOTE__: You do not need to fork this repo to install/use the liberator tool.\n\nRun the following (you'll be prompted for you github username and password):\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g git+https://github.com/hackreactor/liberator.git\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Personal Access Token\n\nLiberator *requires* you to create a GitHub Personal Access Token so it can rewrite the git history of your sprints. A guide to how to create one of these tokens can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/). \n\nCreate a token with the following privileges: `repo`, `public_repo`, `delete_repo`, and `user`.\n\nThe first time you run use the tool via `liberate`, you will be prompted for this token.\n\n### Email Settings\n\nYou should also make sure that the option `Block command line pushes that expose my email` under _Settings > Personal Settings > Email_ is NOT checked. This should be the default setting.\n\n## Usage\n\n<!-- Currently broken. Commented out by FZ on 7/12/2017\n### All At Once\n\nIf you want to liberate _all_ of your [eligible repositories](#eligible-repos), run: \n\n```sh\nliberate --hackreactor all\n```\n-->\n\n### One By One\n\nYou can also liberate them one (or a few) at a time, by listing the repositories in a space-separated list after the tool:\n\n#### Single Repo\n\n```sh\nliberate --hackreactor hrsf92-databases  # Note no trailing slash (/)\n```\n\n#### Multiple Repos\n\n```sh\nliberate --hackreactor hrsf92-chatterbox-client hrsf92-chatterbox-server\n```\n\n### Fix Previously-Liberated Repos\n\nIn the previous versions of Liberator (prior to 14 Jan 2017), there was a bug where the author/committer remains as `Hack Reactor Student` after the repo has been liberated (for Hack Reactor students only).\n\nThe bug has been fixed in the version released on 14 Jan 2017. If you liberated your repos before then, you should install the latest version of Liberator, and use the 'fix' flag to fix the repos so that you get credit for your work:\n\n```sh\nliberate --hackreactor --fix all\n```\n\nNote that the 'fix' flag must be used with the 'all' argument. You cannot fix each repo individually. **You should only use the 'fix' command once.**\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n#### Trouble installing\n\nTry cloning Liberator and installing it manually:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/hackreactor/liberator.git\ncd liberator\nnpm install -g  # The -g is important!\n```\n\nThis will install Liberator as if it was from npm itself. You can delete the local clone and still have access to the `liberate` command.\n\nFor example:\n```sh\nnode index.js --hackreactor hrsf92-databases\n```\n\n#### Trouble writing to `config.json`\n\nYou may have the wrong file permissions where you install global `node_modules`, if you receive this error message:\n\n```sh\nError: EACCES, permission denied '/usr/local/lib/node_modules/liberator/config.json'\n```\n\nIn this case, you'll need to give your node process permissions to write the configuration file by running the following command:\n\n```sh\nsudo chmod 777 /usr/local/lib/node_modules/liberator\n```\n\n#### Trouble writing to `archive`\n\nRun:\n\n```sh\nsudo chown -R `whoami`  /usr/local/lib/node_modules/liberator/archive\n```\n\n## Eligible Repos\n\nLiberator will only work on the following repos:\n- a-synchronous-swim\n- backcast\n- 6ees6ees6ees\n- beesbeesbees\n- blackjack\n- chatterbox-client\n- chatterbox-server\n- cruddy-todo\n- data-structures\n- databases\n- fullstack-review\n- javascript-koans\n- layout\n- looper\n- middleware\n- mini-apps\n- mini-apps-1\n- mini-apps-2\n- mvp\n- mvp-starter\n- mytunes\n- n-queens\n- ng-cast\n- oath\n- promises\n- react-components\n- recast.ly\n- recastly-redux\n- recursion\n- recursion-review\n- shortly-angular\n- shortly-deploy\n- shortly-express\n- siskel\n- solo\n- sqool\n- subclass-dance-party\n- testbuilder\n- timecop\n- twiddler\n- twittler\n- underbar\n- underbar-review\n- vertebrae\n- watchout\n- web-historian\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/hackreactor/liberator/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/hackreactor/liberator#readme","_id":"liberator@1.0.0","_shasum":"4e413704d68dc60930af64f3911d3c6feb550a62","_from":"git+https://github.com/hackreactor/liberator.git","_resolved":"git+https://github.com/hackreactor/liberator.git#ef95ef1b05d737e9c6a705dfff09ecc0a6f0c870"}
